Mixins documents/schemamixins/bussablemixins/signalable Tutorials KB Usage Usage Shinstrapshinstrap is a WIP fork of the ink-docstrap jsdoc template. jsdoc allows you to comment your code following particular patterns which can then be processed (by jsdoc) to generate documentation automatically. docstrap is a template designed to generate jsdoc documentation with certain features--sunlight syntax highlighting for code blocks, full text search, bootstrap styling, to name a few. The primary purpose of the shinstrap fork of the docstrap template is to add the ability to create and use new jsdoc tags to your documentation. shinstrap allows you to control how you want to display new and old jsdoc comments without resorting to writing a new template. The capabilities exposed by this template allow comments in code to document semantic relationships and meanings which go beyond the basic semantics of javascript. You can comment tasks in Grunt, routes in Express, or as this template itself demonstrates, its own template files. You can make new tags to document env variables and settings you honor or which impact your behavior, and these documentation fragments can even be aggregated in various ways. Of course, you can also augment the documentation generated by this template with various display sugar like collapsible panes, icons and the like with minimal effort (in fact this last one I demonstrate in brief in shinstrap's own documentation). With the ability to provide your own templates you can create dependency charts and the like in d3 and embed them into your documentation. The possibilities are really endless. To get started, checkout the Usage guide. Installation(! Not Yet Released on npm !) To install shinstrap you can use npm: npm install --save-dev shinstrapRemember you need jsdoc as well: npm install --save-dev jsdocRequirementsThis package is a template for jsdoc, and as such requires jsdoc in order to have a purpose. See the Usage guide or jsdoc's own documentation for more details. New templates optionsThe templates section of your jsdoc configuration json file is where template specific settings are expected to go. shinstrap leverages these settings as the primary method for customizing the output of this jsdoc generator template. See Usage for more details. favicon : If specified, will set the favicon for the generated documentation. Because of limitations in some browsers, the specified image will be converted to a datauri and stored on (every) generated page. supplementalCSS : Custom supplemental css file options for simple tweaks. Can be either a string or an array to a resource path location where the css file(s) in question are located. \"supplementalCSS\": [ \"local.css\", \"node_modules/@me/my-plugin/itscss.css\" ]supplementalJS : A string or array of strings to the javascript resource files to be included on each page of the generated documentation. supplementalFonts : A string or array of string paths for any font files to be included with the generated documentation's static files. templateOverrideDir : Specify a directory in which to place custom documentation templates. These can be referenced from your jsdoc configuration files in the tag descriptors specified in the customizeOutput section of the templates section. This directory does override the standard templates directory, allowing one to override standard templates like container.tmpl. customizeOutput : An object which allows customization of listing generation ordering and output. customizeOutput is made up of three sections-- The menus section which allows for the custom specification of menus into which \"tutorials\" may be organized. The doclets section which allows the specification of custom pre-processing and handling for a given doclet type. Zero or more tmpl customization sections, allowing the specification of entry order by template specifier path, with defaults, as well as specification of custom tag display handling (again by specifier path). ! Note This package uses evals in a few places to augment documentation generation. It is my belief that as a developer tool used to document source code to which you clearly have access, this doesn't represent a security issue (although it could allow for some interesting mistakes). It is possible that in certain large orgs with hard to predict separation of responsibilities and access that this could represent a problem, especially with automated documentation generation. This should still be a manageable security issue, just treat your .jsdoc.json with similar precautions to the rest of your protected sources. Issues (poor man's version) That screenshot is blurry and terrible!!! The scoping of sections is \"naive\", and largely inherited from jsdoc's default template. This poorly worded issue is a reminder to myself to reconsider the section specifiers used to identify which sections of the generated documentation a set of custom output configurations applies to. (i.e. the structure of customizeOutput). See commentary on this topic in DESIGN.md#Design Notes. It is not hard to imagine wanting this to be an actual semantic description which discovers its own scope from reflection on the template being rendered, but that's out of scope for the moment. Any work here could also include special casing options by the access level being rendered. For example, it could be a thing to only render design tags in a generation invoked with -p. Of course, one could just make a separate configuration file for each documentation case, which makes more sense to me, possibly (although proliferation of files...)--e.g. .jsdoc.internal.json and .jsdoc.client.json... Something to think about anyway. As with the original templates from which it was derived, there is no error handling or debugging for documentation generation per se. This could be added as a feature. Debugging documentation generation, especially when documenting a large project for the first time can be exceptionally time consuming for people who are not currently deeply invested in jsdoc patterns. The naming conventions for classes in docstrap is inconsistant as written. I leave correction of this for a shinzen template--shinstrap's output is intended to be structurally consistant with docstrap (including classes on elements). These are, of course, overridable. Similarly, these templates could probably use some re-syncing with the original jsdoc default templates. attribs in toc (e.g. the right hand side toc) The \"issue\" here, is members in the toc display attributes. It might be desireable to have that display controlled by something. Conversely, it might also be nice to be able to decorate other toc-heading displays with alternate information depending on type, etc. This is a specific case of a broader question of customization of nav titles. One might like icons, etc. Right now, these are largely generated by \"client\" side javascript. Unit tests. One could imagine a set of unit tests for jsdoc templates and a second, less useful set for shinstrap. Also some unit tests for shinstrap templates specifically (partial.scaffolded.* and listing.scaffolded.*). One could get arbitrarily \"silly\" by wiring in a relationship between documented @honors specifications with actual behavior, at least for known settings (non-template settings). Feels pretty marginal utility to me though. Data specifier. Currently there is an explicit association between the tag name and where its information lives on the doclet or data fragment. This has proven to work fine in all my use cases thus far, but it's not hard to imagine a scenario where someone might wish to refer to another part of the doclet, and its not clear that the system as written can cover all these scenarios. \"default\" listing suppression--There is no easy way to suppress the rendering of a default listing in shinstrap Futures I thought I mentioned this somewhere, but it feels extremely useful to either allow preprocessing replacement inline tags (like {@currentVersion}), and/or to make information available from git/package.json available in jsdoc/env or some other mechanism to the plugins. Some of this involves chicken and egg issues, like that example ({@currentVersion}) only becomes derivable when a commit or a git tag or npm version is executed ({@currentCommit}). This speaks to this being an issue beyond the scope of this package, per se, but rather a larger documentation ecosystem. The full text search capabilities of this package could be significantly enhanced with the creation of an sqlite database and using its full-text search capabilities along with a \"contextualizer\" (I forget the sqlite name) to inform various important details of the sources for search criteria, particularly semantic information. This doubly so because we have the doclet tree from which to build out the database. A \"live\" or client side \"cache\" of the AST could prove useful for many other features, including client-side exploration of various relationships via various data visualizers. On the subject of data visualizers, I could include some examples thereof. I have an @tag example in shin-jsdoc-tags which could be used to make a tag graph (if, you know, I used it). This template could be extended to allow for some measure of error handling, mostly in the form of reporting unexpected input to enhance \"debugging\" situations where generated documentation does not live up to expectations :). Add a generateLandingPage option, to generate a page for doclets which normally would not generate a page of their own (say you had an alternate sort of \"class\" or whatever). Do a find on the doclet kind; tie into see mechanics to wire up links; call generate to generate the page. Theoretically feasible. Such pages could also be used for other types of aggregators, for instance, tagging functions in a group or an \"aspect\", a landing page displaying modules/functions by author or design group, etc. Or by access-group (see below). And so on. This mechanism would probably include a template handler binding for the generated doclet, but if not container.tmpl would want to be able to defer to another template similar to how it handles doc.kind===\"class\" atm. Introduce \"access-scopes\", for custom access grouping/displays. One step away from TBA style tag filtering. The idea would be to allow setting an access scope like \"For Developers\" or \"Sites Group\" or whatever, possibly as a first order entity with its own doclet and page generation, but specifically to allow tagging of other doclets for filtering when creating documentation to allow making docs for specific audiences. I debate introducing useScaffolded for usePartial, usePerItemScaffolded for usePerItemPartial, usePreItemMapScaffolded for usePerItemMapPartial (and any others I missed?). defer does not need a deferScaffolded as alternateHandler should serve that purpose. Grouping and Collapsibility (wire in bootstrap's collapse pattern) Add a medal decorator item marshaller (so one can decorate certain items with specific medals, e.g. Deprecated or Not Implemented, Template-Helper, etc.) This possibly wants to be something more generic and bindable, possibly decorated in various fashions (short/brief, verbose, decorated, listing) for based on the context being displayed (e.g. in a toc, as a title, in a list, etc). I have commented.. somewhere on the idea of pre-processed expansions (e.g. {@CurrentVersion}). Another fun example of a preprocessor expansion would be hitting your github/webservice to pull issues related to the entity being documented. Internal feature requests, api expansions, etc. could be annotated and included in generated documentation based on the context for said generation. Which reminds me to comment somewhere about the idea of targetted documentation--jsdoc provides a seldom used ability to scope the generated documentation according to programmatic scope (allowing, basically an internal and an external set of documentation). As noted in access-groups above, there are several other scenarios and targetted documentation types you might want to be able to create, and there is no (good) reason why this system shouldn't be able to accomodate. Adopt a proper template plugin pattern. Another pet peeve is the disconnect between markdown generation and jsdoc generation, particularly in the area of links. It would be nice if I could put in a link to say, Usage.md in a document which is going to go through both markdown and jsdoc and have it link to the \"right\" file. Probably via a preprocessor in jsdoc. The details are a bit complicated, having to do with targets and context and what not. A markdown link to a file which will be generated (but may not be) in a reference list at the end of the markdown document, with some sort of patch processor to fixup registered markdown documents to update their references when they reference jsdoc documentation... in situ when the file is a tutorial or README.md as its processed for use, but also external to the process for files on disks... But which version do I want to link to, though? The private/internally generated docs' version? The public? Seems problematic. A handle-like link registry is what we want, but is out of scope for markdown. And also you can nearly achieve the same thing through conventions. docs/, internal-docs/, make your link and if it has been generated... Of course also not hard to imagine more nuanced features at the point where you had a more robust system. Meh, irritating. Merge in wicked type functionality, which is effectively a template itself, to allow direct exportation to github wiki format. One could even envision extending jsdoc to have a generator plugin separate from the template, to generate marshalled output, but that might be splitting nits. Re-scope the documentation for older docstrap documentation. Either as part of shinmark or as a replacement markdown plugin, scan for some custom tag to cause jsdoc generation for referenced files. Similar for link fixups (I think I referenced this somewhere). So, for example, I could reference .jsdoc.json in a markdown doc and get a link to a source file generated by jsdoc for that file. This is probably the realm of jsdoc rather than a template, but... Extended package.json derived documentation, allowing one to pick up and associate via find-like syntax values in package.json. For instance, grabbing the contributes.configuration settings from a vscode extension's package.json or the build settings from something under shin-grunt-build-tasks (to decorate the README.md with, for instance). Also added to the data namespace for markdown/shinmark for reference in markdown commentary. Create a separate manifest templates setting as a general clearing house for files to include as \"static\" files with the generated documentation as a separate logical setting from the various supplemental* settings. Then add a specific set of general includes (for &lt;link&gt;s and &lt;script&gt;s which need to be added to every page). One could even imagine creating a scoped include specification to include css or js files conditionally by scope. For example, to add a particular css file only for pages listing memberofs a specific module (e.g. client vs. server modules, by team, render thread vs. server thread, and so on). ChangelogSee Changelog for change history. About these docsThe documentation in this repos' wiki was generated using this template and jsdoc pointing at itself. As a fork of docstrap, there is a host of documentation derived from that project which has not [yet] been modified, and is largely \"noise\" at this elevation for most users. The primary bits to look at should be described in more detail in the Usage document. As a shorthand/fallback, however, the primary documents to look at are the module:template/publish module and the module:template/publish~view \"namespace\" which documents the helper functions available in scope of every template (tmpl) file, which are the primary renderers for templates in jsdoc. ! Below is the old README for docstrap, unmodified (afaik) Other useful \"stuff\" :tm: ;) -- vscode .tmpl colorizer vvv Original DocStrap README vvv DocStrap DocStrap is Bootstrap based template for JSDoc3. In addition, it includes all of the themes from Bootswatch giving you a great deal of look and feel options for your documentation, along with a simple search. Additionally, it adds some options to the conf.json file that gives you even more flexibility to tweak the template to your needs. It will also make your teeth whiter. Features Right side TOC for navigation in pages Integrated offline search Themed Customizable Syntax highlighting What It Looks LikeHere are examples of this template with the different Bootswatch themes: Cerulean Cosmo Cyborg Flatly Journal Lumen Paper Readable Sandstone Simplex Slate Spacelab Superhero United Yeti To change your theme, just change it in the conf.json file. See below for details. Ooooh, I want it! How do I get it?If you manage your own version of jsdoc: npm install ink-docstrapWhen using grunt, please look at grunt-jsdoc which you can use with docstrap. Command Line Examplejsdoc -c path/to/conf.json -t ./node_modules/ink-docstrap/template -R README.md -r .The -c sets the config, and the docstrap README does talk about the options you can put in templates that docstrap is supposed to look for. The -t sets the template. This is the option you need to set to get the docstrap template to be used. The -R sets a markdown file to be the front page of the documentation. The -r tells jsdoc to run recursively. The . says from current directory. Configuring the templateDocStrap ships with a conf.json file in the template/ directory. It is just a regular old JSDoc configuration file, but with the following new options: \"templates\": { \"systemName\" : \"{string}\", \"footer\" : \"{string}\", \"copyright\" : \"{string}\", \"includeDate\" : \"{boolean}\", \"navType\" : \"{vertical|inline}\", \"theme\" : \"{theme}\", \"linenums\" : \"{boolean}\", \"collapseSymbols\" : \"{boolean}\", \"inverseNav\" : \"{boolean}\", \"outputSourceFiles\" : \"{boolean}\" , \"outputSourcePath\" : \"{boolean}\", \"dateFormat\" : \"{string}\", \"syntaxTheme\" : \"{string}\", \"sort\" : \"{boolean|string}\", \"search\" : \"{boolean}\" } Options systemName The name of the system being documented. This will appear in the page title for each page footer Any markup want to appear in the footer of each page. This is not processed at all, just printed exactly as you enter it copyright You can add a copyright message below the footer and above the JSDoc timestamp at the bottom of the page includeDate By default, the current date is always shown in the footer of the generated documentation. You can omit the current date by setting this option to false navType The template uses top level navigation with dropdowns for the contents of each category. On large systems these dropdowns can get large enough to expand beyond the page. To make the dropdowns render wider and stack the entries vertically, set this option to \"inline\". Otherwise set it to \"vertical\" to make them regular stacked dropdowns. theme This is the name of the them you want to use in all lowercase. The valid options are cerulean cosmo cyborg flatly journal lumen paper readable sandstone simplex slate spacelab superhero united yeti linenums When true, line numbers will appear in the source code listing. If you have also turned that on. collapseSymbols If your pages have a large number of symbols, it can be easy to get lost in all the text. If you turn this to true all of the symbols in the page will roll their contents up so that you just get a list of symbols that can be expanded and collapsed. analytics Add a Google Analytics code to the template output e.g. \"analytics\":{\"ua\":\"UA-XXXXX-XXX\", \"domain\":\"XXXX\"} ua The google agent (see Google Analytics help for details) domain The domain being served. (see Google Analytics help for details) inverseNav Bootstrap navbars come in two flavors, regular and inverse where inverse is generally higher contrast. Set this to true to use the inverse header. outputSourceFiles When true, the system will produce source pretty printed file listings with a link from the documentation. outputSourcePath When outputSourceFiles is false, you may still want to name the file even without a link to the pretty printed output. Set this to true when outputSourceFiles is false. outputSourceFiles when true takes precedence over this setting. dateFormat The date format to use when printing dates. It accepts any format string understood by moment.js syntaxTheme String that determines the theme used for code blocks. Default value is \"default\". It can be any value supported at sunlight themes which right now consists of...uh...\"default\" and \"dark\", but at least you have it if you need it. sort Defaults to true. Specifies whether jsdoc should sort data or use file order. Can also be a string and if so it is passed to jsdoc directly. The default string is \"longname, version, since\". search By default, the template includes a quick search box. For large APIs, the search database can be too expensive to load. If needed you can disable this feature setting this option to false. Syntax HighlightingLanguageThe default language will be JavaScript, but there are a couple of ways to secify the language. DocStrap support the language specified in the standard way e.g. ```html &lt;html&gt;&lt;/html&gt;DocStrap also introduces a new documentation tag which can appear inside any example block in source code, or in any fenced code block in markdown: {@lang languageName}, where language can be any of the languages supported by Sunlight When in a doclet, add the tag just after the @example tag like this: @example {@lang xml} &lt;div&gt;This is the most interesting web site ever&lt;/div&gt; These are the supported languages. ActionScript bash C/C++ C♯ CSS Diff DOS batch Erlang Haskell httpd (Apache) Java JavaScript Lisp Lua MySQL nginx Objective-C Perl PHP PowerShell Python Ruby Scala T-SQL VB.NET XML (HTML) Example CaptionIf you want a caption to your example, add it in a HTML caption before your example e.g. @example &lt;caption&gt;my caption&lt;/caption&gt; {@lang xml} &lt;mycode&gt;&lt;/mycode&gt;Customizing DocStrapNo template can meet every need and customizing templates is a favorite pastime of....well, no-one, but you may need to anyway. First make sure you have bower and grunt-cli installed. Fetch the source using git or grab the zip file from github. and unzip it somewhere. Everything that follows happens in the unzip directory. Next, prepare the environment: bower installand npm installWhen that is done, you have all of the tools to start modifying the template. The template, like Bootstrap, uses less. The way it works is that ./styles/main.less pulls in the bootstrap files uncompiled so that you have access to all of bootstraps mixins, colors, etc, that you would want. There are two more files in that directory, variables.less, bootswatch.less. These are the theme files and you can modify them, but keep in mind that if you apply a new theme (see below) those files will be overwritten. It is best to keep your changes to the main.less file. To compile your changes to main.less and any other files it loads up, grunt lessThe output is will be put in ./template/static/styles/site.&lt;theme-name&gt;.css. The next time you create your documentation, it will have the new css file included. To apply a different template to the styles directory to modify, open up the conf.json in the template directory and change the theme option to the theme you want. Then grunt applyAnd the new theme will be in variables.less, bootswatch.less. Don't forget to compile your changes using grunt apply to get that change into the template. NOTE that these steps are not necessary to just change the theme, this is only to modify the theme. If all you want to do is change the theme, just update conf.json with the new theme and build your docs! ContributingYes! Contribute! Test! Share your ideas! Report Bugs!

It is a pretty clean little class whose primary purpose is to surface the composition chains and a basis for storing options on mixin and subclass instances. Options are handled at the instance rather than the prototype level so that multiple instances don't compete for default values. new base() Parameters: Type Description Extends base/chains members close The close method asks an object to shut itself down in a way that will allow it to be reopened, unlike the end method which will call the destroy method which should make the object unusable, but also devoid of all resources whereas close may still keep some resources open.

Inherited From: base/chains#open See: base/chains#close methods addDefaultOptions(options) Add a default option to a class. The default options are only set if there is not already a value for the option. Parameters: Name Type Description options hash A hash of options you want to set See: {base#addOptions} addOptions(options) Add an option to a class. If any members of the hash already exist in this.options, they will be overwritten. Parameters: Name Type Description options hash A hash of options you want to set See: {base#addDefaultOptions} destroy() Called when it is time to get rid of all of your instance level references and objects and events. You can define this method on your own classes without having to call the superclass instance. It is called by instance.end() automatically Overrides: base/chains#destroy See: {base/chains#end} {base/chains#destroy} end() Call this to close your object and dispose of all maintained resources. You can define this method on your own classes without having to call the superclass instance, however it is reccomended that you put all disposal code in destroy().

You can return the value directly, just raise an event or whatever your little heart demands.

See jsdoc/templates/default/publish.js (no link because, ironically, jsdoc didn't comment their templates :) ). In addition to docstrap's baseline of features, shinstrap primarily adds customization. The order and organization of default tags can be changed (from configuration settings), as well as new rules to allow for the rendering of custom tags. The menus for tutorials can likewise be customized.shinstrap adds a few simple features to override the built-in templates even for complex reworks with a minimum amount of futzing. Full details should be available in the Usage.md document in this module's documentation (or in design/Usage.md) [Usage]. namespaces view templates attribs Template File: partial.scaffolded.attribs.tmpl Honors the following configuration settings: Name Type Description template.displayStyle string One of buttons, badges or csl describing how the doclet's attribs should be displayed. The \"first\" scaffolded partial template, this template controls the display of attributes. This partial is designed to fit in with the display layout of docstrap, attempting to provide a \"terse\" easy rendering of the attributes for an entity. By default, this template is called from method.tmpl and members.tmpl. container Template File: container.tmpl The \"root\" level display template for jsdoc. container.tmpl marhalls and displays most of the doclets which have their own landing page. This includes modules, interfaces, classes, namespace, events, mixins, etc. displayed as &lt;article&gt;s. This template is broken into two sections in docstrap, an \"overview\" section and what I am calling the body. Display of contents of the \"overview\" area are controlled in the customizeOutput area of the template's configuration by the specifier path:\"container:article:overview:...\"This specifier has three branches -- \"class\", \"module-with-modules\" and the default (every other case). This is a legacy of docstrap The \"body\" portion of this template's display is controlled by the specifier path:\"container:article:body:default\" details Template File: details.tmpl One of the three workhorse templates for jsdoc display. details.tmpl marshals and displays the details of a doclet. Specifically...[ \"properties\", \"version\", \"since\", \"inherits\", \"overrides\", \"implementations\", \"implements\", \"mixes\", \"deprecated\", \"author\", \"copyright\", \"license\", \"defaultvalue\", \"meta\", \"tutorials\", \"see\", \"todo\" ] General Template File: listing.scaffolded.general.tmpl Honors the following configuration settings: Name Type Default Description entryWrapper string The tag which the entire entry should be wrapped in. For situations where you want to wrap both the title and the contents. For example, when making a &lt;details&gt; entry or a &lt;fieldset&gt; entry. entryWrapperAttributes string The attributes which should be rendered for the entityWrapper. Only valid if entityWrapper has a value. suppressTitle boolean If true, no title will be generated. This causes title, titleCaption and titleAttributes to be ignored. outerTitleWrapper string The \"outer\" wrapper for the title (title only supports two \"tiers\" of wrappers). outerTitleAttributes string The attributes to associate with the outer title tag. titleWrapper string The tag to wrap the title in. titleCaption string A string with which to replace the normally auto-generated title text. (See module:template/publish.handleScaffolding) titleContextPluralize object Causes the title to be pluralized if the doclet is an array with more than one member. This object has two fields--singular and plural, the value for each is used as the title in their respective cases. titleWrapperAttributes string The attributes to associate with the title tag. suppressValue boolean false If true, no value will be display for this entry. This causes the various wrapper and use* descriptors to be ignored. outermostWrapper string listing.scaffolded.general.tmpl allows for up to three tiers of embedded html wrappers.This is the outermost wrapper. outermostWrapperAttributes string The attributes to assign to the outermostWrapper. outerWrapper string The \"second tier\" or outer html wrapper for an entry value. outerWrapperAttributes string The attributes to assign to the outerWrapper. wrapper string If usePartial is not set, wrapper indicates the tag in which to wrap the value of this listing. wrapperAttributes string The attributes to associate with the wrapping tag. usePartial string The template to display the tag's value with. usePartialOnField string When usePartial is set, allows the specification of which field on the doclet to supply to the partial as its data. usePerItemPartial string In the event that the entry's value is an array, usePerItemPartial allows the specification of a partial template to be used on each value in this entry's value array. This setting is overridden by usePartial. perItemMapPartial object If set, this setting allows the specification of an object, where each field name in the object is an expression, which if it evaluates to true will cause this template to use as a partial the value of that field. Conditions are tested in order and used on a first found basis. If a \"default\" field is specified, it will be used in the event none of the other conditions evaluate to true. usePartial and usePerItemPartial both override this setting. alternateHandler string itemMarshalling array :advanced: This is an array of view helpers and parameters to execute on each entry's value before rendering it. The format for each call is [\"functionName\", \"param1\", \"param2\", ...]. An arbitrary number of marshal calls may be made, and they will be executed in order (e.g. itemMarshalling: [ [ \"linkto\", \"\", \"\" ] ]). Param specifications are relative to the entry value itself (for brevity), so \"\" references the entry value itself, and \"kind\" would reference data.kind (for instance). find object :advanced: validate object :advanced: This is the general case listing handler for shinstrap. KeyValue Template File: listing.scaffolded.kv.tmpl Honors the following configuration settings: Name Type Description titleWrapper string The tag to wrap the title in. titleCaption string A string with which to replace the normally auto-generated title text. (See module:template/publish.handleScaffolding) titleWrapperAttributes string The attributes to associate with the title tag. usePartial string The template to display the tag's value with. usePartialOnField string When usePartial is set, allows the specification of which field on the doclet to supply to the partial as its data. wrapper string If usePartial is not set, wrapper indicates the tag in which to wrap the value of this listing. wrapperAttributes string The attributes to associate with the wrapping tag. This template handles the display of key-value pairs. For instance, Type: {Object} method Template File: method.tmpl One of the three workhorse templates for jsdoc display. method.tmpl marshals and displays the common features of javascript entites and is used for methods, classes (when not on their own landing page), typedefs, and events. This is a common template to leverage for complex custom tags as well. By default it displays...[ \"description\", \"augments\", \"type\", \"this\", \"params\", \"details\", \"requires\", \"fires\", \"listens\", \"listeners\", \"exceptions\", \"returns\", \"examples\" ] source Template File: source.tmpl This template controls the presentation of source files by jsdoc (when \"outputSourceFiles\": true). tutorial Template File: tutorial.tmpl This template controls the presentation of tutorials by jsdoc. methods publish(taffyData, opts, tutorials) This is the primary entry point into docstrap (and shinstrap). Parameters: Name Type Description taffyData TAFFY See http://taffydb.com/. opts object tutorials Tutorial utils.addScopeToAttribs(_doclet) This is a simple helper function which simple adds a doclet's scope to its attribs collection. This is normally done in publish by calling jsdoc/util/templateHelper.getAttribs but that helper function only adds scope attribs for doclets of specific kinds. For custom doclet types, we have this function. Parameters: Name Type Description _doclet object The doclet for which to accumulate attributes. utils.buildNamespaceLink() Stub marshalling function to build namespace links. utils.capitalize(_string) This is a simple helper function to capitalize a string. It is currently not wired into the system, being \"pre\" deprecated ;). Parameters: Name Type Description _string string The string to capitalize utils.handleScaffolding(_tmpl, _doclet, _arrangement, _listing, _title) This is the primary helper function for the new custom listing mechanism. All listings are now routed through this method and, in conjunction with listing.scaffolded.general.tmpl, the capabilities of the custom listing declarations are enabled. Parameters: Name Type Description _tmpl object The template object for which this function is doing the scaffolding _doclet object Doclet object being described _arrangement object Describes how the listing should be displayed _listing string The portion of the doclet being documented _title string The doclet title as understood in the current template. Not the title of the listing being documented. Returns: The rendered HTML for the doclet or doclet fragment passed in. Type string utils.marshalItemDisplay(_item, _marshallingRules, _view) This is the handler function for the itemMarshalling rule. This function will interpret the arrangment and the marshalling rules in the context of the indicated _item to derive the appropriate parameters, invoke the indicated function and return the result to the calling template. Parameters: Name Type Description _item object The display item or doclet being marshalled. _marshallingRules object The marshalling rules which dictate the handling of this item's marshalling. _view object The template view which is handing the rendering of this listing. Returns: \"marshalled\" html representation for _item as indicated in the _marshallingRules. Type string utils.renderDoclet(_arrangement, _defaults, _docOrData) The default rendering pattern for a sectioned/named renderer (template). Parameters: Name Type Description _arrangement object The rules array for the doclet/fragment being rendered. _defaults array The default array of entries which are expected/valide for this doclet. _docOrData object | array | string The doclet or fragment being rendered. ToDo: Once I'm satisfied, this function should probably replace all the renderer snippets. utils.resolveArrangement(_aSelectors) This function resolves two sets of information for doclets of the specified selectors... It will determine the order which tags are intended to be displayed in the listing. It will generate the tags descriptor object for all tags.This information is derived from the conf settings passed into the publish module. remarks I debate here whether I should capture in the closure the entirety of conf.customizeOutput or if I should instead pass it in on the stack (which might also allow for some recursive/contextual resolution in the future)... Parameters: Name Type Description _aSelectors Array An array of selectors indicating for which context to resolve the arrangement information. The last (most specific) specifier in the array may be replaced by \"default\" (although because of the behavior for unrecognized specifiers, this is just a convention) Returns: An object consisting of two fields--An order field as an array of listings to be displayed, and a tags field containing any custom listing specifications for that section. If the specified path is not found, the default arrangment will be returned ({ order: [ \"*\" ] , tags: {} }). If the specified path exists, but the specific specifier does not (e.g. container:article:body:module-with-modules) this function will return the default arrangement for that path, as specified in the all keyword, if present. { order: [ \"description\", \"notes\", \"remarks\", \"*\" ], tags: {} } Type object Example var arrangement = resolveArrangement([ \"container\", \"article\", \"body\", \"default\" ]); utils.scaffoldFromSpecifier(_tmpl, _doclet, _tagSpecifier) This is a simple wrapper on module:template/publish.utils.handleScaffolding which will retrieve the rules for a listing from a specifier (and then call handleScaffolding with those rules for the specified listing). Parameters: Name Type Description _tmpl object The template object for which this function will be doing the scaffolding. _doclet object The doclet or fragment being rendered. _tagSpecifier string A colon-delimeted specifier to the rules which dictate the rendering pattern for the doclet. Returns: HTML for the doclet or doclet fragment passed in. Type string buildNav(members) Create the navigation sidebar. Parameters: Name Type Description members object The members that will be used to create the sidebar. Properties Name Type Description classes array.&lt;object&gt; externals array.&lt;object&gt; globals array.&lt;object&gt; mixins array.&lt;object&gt; interfaces array.&lt;object&gt; modules array.&lt;object&gt; namespaces array.&lt;object&gt; tutorials array.&lt;object&gt; events array.&lt;object&gt; Returns: The HTML for the navigation sidebar.

Percolation/RFC IssuesThese are, theoretically, the issues I'm currently pondering on a \"design\" level. I want to add a warn/log level functions. I know I said I wasn't going to change how docstrap worked for error handling/reporting, but it's driving me a bit loopy to continue in this state of \"wrongness\". Some doclets get extra, special handling within docstrap before being rendered. If we want to enable such things ourselves, we need to extend publish to patch in settings from the conf settings. The trickiness here is that doclet are not tags, this is a separate level of reference :(. Currently I do this in customizeOutput.doclets.*.processing which probably should be called preprocessing, but also is an extremely limited solution. More exploration is needed to determine a \"better\" one, however. extends from method.tmpl and implementors from details.tmpl have not been tested. Allow setting of \"master\" defaults used in listing.scaffolded.general.tmpl? I contemplate replacing eval processing with a finite set of flags for each specific use case once I have them all enumerated. -- Increasingly less inclined to do so. [Sideways] Convert to using one env (which would then be unpacked in handleScaffolding)? Here I mean title and kind in addition to doc/data rather than passing them in individually no the stack. This is totally the way a sandbox call would end up being built. Upon looking at it, there are only a few cases in use at the moment. I'm strongly inclined to enumerate them directly as mentioned above, but I'm leaving it in for now while I test. In the interim, I put in the env, but decided instead to simply access all the relevent information directly (e.g. from _doclet.kind, etc.). In my testing these are always the same, but I haven't tunneled into the code enough to verify this to be factual. [No] Perhaps I should to use a json merge algorithm for defaults in the main tmpl files (e.g. container.tmpl). _.defaults(object, *defaults). The issue here is unintended consequences and desired precedence. At the moment, something which has a default is entirely overwritten if you set any preference for it. If you were only intending to tweak the settings, this might be inconvenient (and even unexpected), but the inverse is also true (having to override each individual setting). I feel like the defaults applying per \"listing\" (or tag) is most intuitive. Which is to say, \"no\", let's not do this. [No] Summary. Do I add summary option with an option to suppress to every tag, basically? if(data.contents.summary &amp;&amp; data.scaffolding.allowSummary)... Why didn't I do a var rules = data.scaffolding at the start of that file, ffs :(? Anyway. I'm inclined to say yes I should, but I suppose the issues are two-fold. First, I'm introducing aberrant behavior--by default, some listings allow summaries while most listings do not. Whichever way I make the default of allowSummary will not match that, although I suppose I control the defaults in each of the aggregator templates, so I can mimic the defaults presumed, and thus I'm simply allowing people to customize more which seems fine. Ok. So then the main problem stems from the structure of the summaryList itself. The summary appears in a &lt;dd&gt; which is both not valid for many other listing formats (which is maybe not my concern), but also not possible within my system as specced atm to emit two values for a listing at different layers. I could add.. what... allowSummary: 'templateName.tmpl' and then.. I guess inside itemMarshalling I could do something like if(data.contents.summary &amp;&amp; data.scaffolding.allowSummary) { self.partial(data.contents.summary, data.scaffolding.allowSummary) } modulo context of not being in a tmpl at that moment. And then I have to add a listing.summary-in-dd.tmpl as the default... I'm feeling very meh about this now. Similarly, the namespaceLinkedSummary.tmpl file ought to be replacable with an application of something more generic, but I haven't figured on a reasonable format that doesn't involve yet another eval. I could allow for an interpolated string with only direct value references (basically a poor man's sandbox). Still conflicted on the whole avoid the eval in an internal dev tool. Tempted to just make a marshaller for this pattern and use itemMarshalling... Would require setting up linkedSummary.tmpl as a customized tmpl, e.g. partial.custom.summarizable.tmpl. This would involve needing to pass in/decorate data.contents with data.scaffolding in the usePartial and usePerItemPartial conditions of each listing.custom.*. This pattern would obviate the need for a allowSummary setting (it's implied by using the summarizable template, right?). It'd look something like this. \"classes\": { find: { kind: 'class', memberof: \"doc.longname\" }, validate: \"doc.kind !== 'globalobj'\", titleWrapper: \"h3\", titleWrapperAttributes: \"class=subsection-title\", outerWrapper: \"dl\", // pretty much required for well-formed html :/... useScaffolded: \"partial.custom.summarizable.tmpl\", itemMarshalling: [ [ \"linkto\", \"\", \"\" ] ] // resolveNamespaceLink for namespaces }; Design GoalsBuild a customizable template to get around those limits of docstrap which irritate me most. Things I don't like about Docstrap... Like most (all?) templates there is no way without changing .tmpl files to add new tags reasonably (without hax, basically). The .tmpl files aught to be built to look through and include AST leaves dynamically. Customizing requires modifying the .less files as specified in their readme below. This is also super fragile. The customization pattern asks you to go into this module's directory and do an npm install and bower install (already unnecessary), so you can then run some grunt tasks to run less. Similar issues with recognizing AST nodes like Tasks or alternates to Tutorials so you could have arbitrary menus like APIs or whatever. I hate the style \"tweak\" methodology below. It's incredibly fragile. Their use of bootstrap is currently broken but also feels fragile Probably unrelated... Shinmark markdown plugin. The plugins in templates do not appear to be used as plugins for the base system. So, basically, the plugin can be its own module, or included with this one, but has to be explicitly referenced from the root .jsdoc.conf. MenusThe original idea was to allow something like: { \"menus\" : { \"APIs\" : { order: 1, \"parents\": [ \"file-name-from-tutorial\" ] } } }Ideally, we'd add what I'm calling atm \"menu\" information to the tutorials directory's config .json (why that json file isn't part of the master config file I don't know). So maybe I should say that ideally I'd merge it into the config json, but either way, these are effectively jsdoc level changes. jsdoc create the doclets for tutorial files and munges them with children and title information within itself before it gets to the template. Now, of course, I can go grab this file again and parse it again. I could even go steal the code from jsdoc to do it so as to ensure the same mapping/discovery. The format I had envisioned would look something like this: { \"test1\": { \"title\": \"Tutorial One\", \"scope\": \"private\", \"menu\": \"APIs\" }, \"test2\": { \"title\": \"Tutorial Two\" } }I don't particularly like the idea of reading it twice. I also think all tutorial information really ought to live in the .jsdoc.json. Multiple files is teh evil. There's some legacy issues with per file .json config files (e.g. test1.json and test2.json). Without drawing a definitive conclusion on this issue, I'm going, for the moment, to put scope information along with the \"menu\" settings currently in customizeOutput. If it matters, the flames will likely inform the final pattern. Of course, once I've looked at the jsdoc source on this topic, it will likely turn out that menus can be subsumed into the parent/child system by simply allowing multiple root parents which would then be the menus (or having the direct children of the current tutorial root be the menus, etc.). OT at this point. Currently we have \"menus\" : { \"APIs\" : { \"title\": \"APIs\", \"order\": 1, // Ignored atm \"members\": [ \"DESIGN\" ], \"access\": \"private\" }, \"Usage\" : { \"title\": \"Usage\", \"members\": [\"Usage\"] } }This means, btw, that access control is by menu and is all or nothing. So we do not have per \"tutorial\" level access. Also there are some ambiguities. If you list the same file as a member of two or more menus, that will actually work (as in they will show up in both menus, or either menu in the event one is access restricted). This does not hold true for tutorials itself. There is currently no way to put a document both in a menu and in the default \"tutorials\" menu. This could be considered a bug. There's also issues with parents &amp; children. ThemesSo, to generate their themes, they use an extended build process. First, you have to configure jsdoc.conf.json (yes that \"example\" conf file), and set it to the theme you want to modify. Then you have to update the .less template files they have for that theme. The links for this are broken, but their documentation says that grunt apply is supposed to update those. Once updated, you can then modify them (they recommend you modify main.less only, probably because the other two get replaced everytime you load a new style). Then you \"build\" your changes by doing grunt less. Then the next time you build your docs, if you use the new modified theme, it will be included in the generated docs directory. So to recap... Install all this module's dependencies (npm install; bower install). Set the theme you want to modify in jsdoc.conf.json (the one inside the mod). Get the updated bootswatch.less and variables.less files by running grunt apply (currently bugged!) Modify the main.less file with the changes you want. Compile the new version of this theme by running grunt less. Rebuild your docs. Note that if you forget what you are doing, and change the theme in jsdoc.conf.json mid process, and then run grunt less later, you will just overwrite that theme. There is no sanity testing of any kind. IdeasI'm thinking I'd like to allow you to set something like this... \"template\": { \"sections\": { \"method\": [ \"description\", \"notes\", \"remarks\", \"*\", \"futures\", \"changelog\" ] } } The idea here being that this would output doclet.description first, if present, than doclet.notes, then doclet.remarks, then all the predefined normal things we understand (params, see also, listens for, etc.), then doclet.futures and finally changelog. We could also allow some additionally configuration by extension... \"templates\": { \"container\" : { \"header\" : { ?? }, \"article\" : { \"overview\": { // Module with modules, Class or every other case... // \"class\", \"module-with-modules\" (cases for container) \"all\" : [ \"desription\", \"task\", \"*\" ], \"kind\" : [], // How to catch the \"module with modules\" case? \"module\" : [] } \"tags\" : { \"task\": { \"suppressTitle\" : false, // Can be ommitted if false \"titleWrapper\": \"h5\", \"titleWrapperAttributes\": \"class=jsdoc-task-title\", \"wrapper\": \"div\", \"wrapperAttributes\" : \"class=jsdoc-task\", } } } } \"containers\" : { \"module\" : [ \"task\" ] \"method\" : [ \"description\", \"algorithm\", \"notes\", \"remarks\", \"*\", \"futures\", \"changelog\" ] } \"container-lists\" : { // Define custom container lists \"tasks\" : { \"lists-kind\": \"task\" } } \"section-details\": { // Only necessary to override defaults; The \"notes\" example I have below is what I imagine the default to be \"notes\" : { \"wrapper\": \"div\", \"class\": \"notes\" }, \"shin-example\": { // So looking for doclet.example, to put it in a &lt;pre&gt; tag with the class \"shin\". Could also do montages. Another idea would be to allow // some simple interpolation so you could maybe do... \"class\" : `${doclet.fullname}-example` or some such. \"leaf\" : \"example\", \"wrapper\" : \"pre\", \"class\" : \"shin\" } }} To override the theme default layout structure. This allows a given project to specify its desired repos setup. I have a growing list of defaults. I'm not sure how pandemic they are, but they may want to move into publish.js rather than being set \"inline\" in their respective tmpl files. container.tmpl (\"overview\"): [ \"container\", \"article\", \"overview\"... ... \"default\" ] ... \"class\" ] ... \"module-with-modules\" ] // Conceptually we're looking at three parts { \"gather\" // The information necessary to know what doclets to display \"validation\" // How to validate the \"gathered\" resources. This is the most controversial one for me because I do not have an exhaustive understanding of the system. \"display\" // How the doclet(s) should be rendered. } // Similarly, there are three general cases or patterns of gathered data. 1. A string (e.g. description) 2. A doclet {object} (e.g. a method) 3.

Some of the issues above (shinmark interpretation of tutorial files, for instance), may require patching jsdoc directly to take advantage of. jsdoc uses markdown-it internally but doesn't expose the parser, save through some hard coded predefines. This would have to be patched in order to allow a custom markdown-it parser to be used. This also aught to be integrated into markdown.js plugin (right now I have a hard-coded version which uses my shinmark lib). If I were to patch this, I would have to decide how to exactly specify or pass in the custom markdown-it parser. This is problematic, of course, because it is specified in a conf.json file, which means I can't instantiate it and pass it in. This may also be relevant to consider in the light of customizing VSC, which also allows a specification of a markdown-it tweaked parser. I should really look at that. Custom markdown-it parser specification at jsdoc root. Custom template with dynamic layout by settings of containers (method, module, class, etc.). Some mechanism for specifying new template files for custom containers and layout files patch configurable. Add a generic container that will basically just layout based on leaves it knows with generic/normal handling of custom leaves. Specify custom added menus (ala. Tutorials) with configurable files listed. Basically, alternate tutorials lists. This probably requires modification of the jsdoc root as well. The markdown parser is specified here. *I've moved jsdoc level issues and thoughts to shin-jsdoc's DESIGN.md file. Design NotesAs it stands, I currently associate templates with customization settings (directly). These are done contextually in the customizeOutput object, using basically a specifier path (e.g. \"container:overview:case\"). The idea basically being {template}:{subsection|branch}*:{branch selector}, where a subsection is a structural section like &lt;article&gt; or &lt;div class=body&gt;, etc. and a branch is a \"major\" template branch (e.g. kind===\"class\", etc. where it makes sense by template). Currently only the container.tmpl has \"branches\". These are obviously artificial and alterable by template as it grows. The final branch selector is probably a bit sloppy, but is designed to allow setting a default for all the final branches. This could probably be rearchitected to allow defaulting anywhere along the path, but I have not done so, as yet. In any event, the idea is you could specify \"container:article:overview:class\" or \"container:article:overview:default\". The former would look for a customizeOutput.container.article.overview.class object to describe the ordering in the \"class\" branch case. If it was not present, it would instead lookd for customizeOutput.container.article.overview.all as the default. If neither are present, it will set the order to `[ \"\" ].\"container:article:overview:default\"on the other hand, simply looks incustomizeOutput.container.article.overview.allor returns[\"*\"]for the order. Tags are determined without consider the \"branch selector\", so in both of the cases above, tag descriptors will be looked for atcustomizeOutput.container.article.overview.tags. If not present, they will be set to defaults (tags: {}`). It may turn out, in the long run, that it is desireable to have more context. This will require some refactoring. The thought here is that one might with to know, for instance if details.tmpl was called from container.tmpl, members.tmpl or method.tmpl, etc. The specifier would need some new rules both for factoring and for determining defaults and fallbacks. Another long term gotcha is that I'm probably going to want to be able to specify a data \"key\" that is different from the rule \"key\". I.e. the \"attribs\" rule may not always want to reference \"data.attribs\". We've seen this already with \"source\", where the \"source\" rule is called \"meta\", iir, because \"meta\" is where the source information is held. It seems as though there are two types of templates--scaffolded and direct pass-through. The former expects to receive a complex object describing what it is displaying, including rules. The later expects just a raw data object (these are the old style). The former would require introduction of scaffolded directed keys, e.g. useScaffoldedPartial, usePerItemScaffoldedPartial, etc. I haven't actually needed any yet. In addition to the standard tag descriptors, I have added the concept of template specific descriptors, to call out options which are only valid on a given template because, presumably, it has special handling for them. These are held in a special template descriptor in the greater tag descriptor. \"attribs\": { \"alternateHandler\": \"partial.scaffolded.attribs.tmpl\", \"template\": { \"displayStyle\": \"badges\" // One of badges, buttons, csl } } So basically, when it comes to generation of html for a specific listing we have.. With three levels of wrap plus title, with the bottom level being forEachable, and we can substitute a partial (in effect at any level by not declaring the levels above/below it)... Other than clear naming... That would give me: outermostWrapper, outerWrapper, wrapper and title with defer (nothing), usePartial (wrapper), usePerItemPartial (wrapper, forEached), and perItemMapPartial maybe will cover all the cases? Then asDefinition.tmpl goes away (save the defaults question), and instead is just \"futures\": { \"titleWrapper\": \"dt\", \"titleCaption\": \"Futures:\", \"titleWrapperAttributes\": \"class='jsdoc-futures-title capitalize-title'\", \"outermostWrapper\": \"dd\", \"outerWrapper\": \"ul\", \"wrapper\": \"li\", }and todo becomes... \"todo\": { \"titleWrapper\": \"dt\", \"titleCaption\": \"ToDo:\", \"titleWrapperAttributes\": \"class='tag-todo method-doc-label method-doc-details-label'\", \"outermostWrapper\": \"dd\", \"outermostWrapperAttributes: \"class=tag-todo\", \"outerWrapper\": \"ul\", \"wrapper\": \"li\", }The linksList.tmpl (e.g. requires) becomes... \"requires\": { validate: \"data.kind !== 'module'\", titleWrapper: \"h5\", titleCaption: \"Requires:\", titleWrapperAttributes: \"class=subsection-title\", \"outerWrapper\": \"ul\", \"wrapper\": \"li\", \"linkto\": [ \"\", \"\" ] };asLinksList.tmpl simply goes away, as it is the non-array case of the above. Upon dealing with details.tmpl I have switched from a linkto specific marshaller to an itemMarshalling rule. itemMarshalling: [ [ \"linkto\", \"\", \"\" ] ] where linkto could be any marshalling function defined on the view (for instance, resolveAuthorLinks). The \"KV\" listing case would remain. Initial notes/planning outlined these cases: the complex case (e.g. method.tmpl, etc.), which uses a custom template to piece together many disparate listings to present a view on a complex doclet. the definition case (e.g. asDefinitionTerm.tmpl) &lt;-- And this could just be a branch in customizedListing.tmpl : This would subsume linkedSummary.tmpl and asDefinition.tmpl the list case (e.g. customizedListing.tmpl) : this would subsume linksList.tmpl and asLinksList.tmpl with the ability to specify asLink, but specifying the params to self.linkto seems problematic short of resorting to more evals. I guess we could do \"item\", \"item.longname\", \"item.name\" and deref manually. Or \"\" for item, and \"name\", etc. for the subfield. That would be workable. a basic title-wrapper/div listing (e.g. customizedListing.tmpl) the KV case (e.g. asKVHeading.tmpl). This format is a-pattern, putting the title (key) and listing (value) inside the same tag (e.g. &lt;H5&gt;) to get something like... Type: [Object] ConventionsFirst, some basic terminology. A doclet is an entity, as defined generally by jsdoc. (e.g. a method, class, module, namespace, etc.). An \"entry\" is a discrete displayable chunk of data in the context of a doclet. A entry can be, itself another doclet or even an array of doclets (e.g. the members of a class, methods in a namespace, etc.). I use the term entry to refer to the overall information being rendered in this context. I use the term \"listing\" to describe the internal name for the entry. So the \"listing\" for the members of a namespace is \"members\". A [display] \"item\", which I don't think I use often, refers to a member of an entry array in the event that an entry is an array of doclets. (e.g. a single member doclet in \"members\"). I've decided to adopt a naming convention for .tmpl documents. A full entry handler will start with listing.. A listing template (maybe I should have called in entry, huh), should be \"deferred\" to, in that it is a complete entry handler in its own right. A fragment template will start with partial.. These templates are expected to be invoked via something like usePartial or usePerItemPartial. A scaffolded template expects to be called from handleScaffolding module:template/publish.handleScaffolding, which primarily means it expects to receive a complex data object containing rendering rules. The exact set or rendering rules a given template will honor should be listed in the template documentation in module:template/publish (not all rules are valid/applicable to all entry renderers). DebatableI have come to refer to each individual display element of a doclet as a \"listing\". Originally, I called them tags (as is demonstrable in the .jsdoc.json). Listings seems better than tags, but I'm not sure it is entirely appropriate either. \"Entry\" might be better? A namespace has entries for the classes and mixins it contains. A module has entries for its methods, mixins, classes, namespaces, requires, augments, typedefs... It still sounds a little awkward, but maybe best. × Search results Close "},"tutorial-DEVLOG.html":{"id":"tutorial-DEVLOG.html","title":"Tutorial: DEVLOG","body":" shinstrap Namespaces template/publish~view Modules basebase/chainsdocuments/binderdocuments/modeldocuments/probedocuments/schemaGruntfileink/collectormixins/bussablemixins/signalablestrings/formattemplate/publishutils/logger Classes basebase/chainsdocuments/modeldocuments/probe.queryOperatorsdocuments/probe.updateOperatorsink/collector~ACollectorink/collector~CollectorBaseink/collector~OCollectormixins/signalable~Signalutils/logger.Logger Mixins documents/schemamixins/bussablemixins/signalable Tutorials KB Usage Usage DEVLOG Dev-logDeveloper log, scratch pad and todo list for shinstrap.

Fix or rollback notes as &lt;details&gt; Fix the default color issue from docstrap in the lumen theme I'm really feeling the need for a manifest to deal with various link up issues with github :(. Again I have an issue with being able to link an image for reference both in github and in the docs. For the moment I'm going to cheat, but this ought to be solvable. The problem is I can't use &lt;base&gt; because of shims. Apparently I can't do direct links either, at least for images, again because of shims. I could do some sort of processing, of course, on the docs/ to fix/alter its links. Review docstrap's toc building code Add an svg badge builder? And some mechanism to tie its use into the template's custom output facilities. I'm torn, because jsdoc generation to docs/ and serving them via github pages seems to work well enough, but there is also wicked which writes straight to github wiki \"format\". I haven't played with github wikis yet, because they weren't necessary, but when I do, I may find having this sort of functionality in shinstrap (or shinzen) would be good and wise :). Issues/Futures, the Dev Edition [Meta]: The link to Usage.md in the README.md is broken because I haven't figured out how to reconcile its url with the url it will present when served via github pages on the https://shizen.github.io/shinstrap site. I had hoped to use a base tag, but unfortunately, github inserts extra junk into relpaths on github rendered markdown. Which is sad. template-helpers. Never bothered to finish implementing them. Would be useful for documenting itemMarshalling in Usage.md. (Now Removed) I removed @templateHelper a while ago, but effectively this is a group aggregator tag. Easy enough to implement at its core. Add some gists for popular tag scenarios like grunt tasks, express routes/web api/REST routes... extend @honors to have a \"valid if\" or \"requires\" column. E.g. titleWrapperAttributes are only valid (well, only used) if titleWrapper exists and suppressTitle is not true. Could also define a precedence column of sorts. [shinzen]: I didn't do this for shinstrap but possibly for shinzen I think I will simplify the tag descriptors by using an interpolated wrapper, rather than wrapper, wrapperAttributes, outerWrapper, outermostWrapper, wrapperBusterBusterBuster... etc. `&lt;h5 class=\"jsdoc-notes-title\"&gt;Notes&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;div class=\"jsdoc-notes\"&gt;${data}&lt;/div&gt;` So I'll end up with find, validate, render, defer, usePartial, usePerItemPartial, perItemMapPartial... Might want to separate the data out to allow for specific marshalling I guess. Could still have alternateHandler just wouldn't need it for KV. The marshaller would be able to handle usePartialOnField cases. 'course it would only work on ES2015+. Item Marshaller will have to be some sort of eval mess too. if usePartial/usePerItemPartial could be evalled, I could dump perItemMapPartial. Sounds nice. Transitions for collapsible. Just a throw out example, anyway, but it ought to have a transition. Something like.. fieldset.jsdoc-redirect { transition: 5s height ease-in-out; overflow: hidden; } fieldset.jsdoc-redirect[data-hide=\"true\"] { height: 0; } fieldset.jsdoc-redirect[data-hide=\"false\"] { height: 100%; }Alternatively, I could follow bootstrap's pattern for collaspible, which is probably the correct answer for shinstrap being.. uh.. bootstrap based... right? the default template coloring that I'm using is a bit fubar. related, I should probably look at fixing docstrap's themer types handling kinda sucks. Specifically I mean the shoe horned testing of data.types.names. If this wasn't literally the only place I'd seen this, I'd be more certain that it should be resolved in a more generalized fashion. It is not quite appropriate for a recursive resolution. This is indicative of a larger issue of the shoe-horned, overly specific nature of just about every aspect of this template, built as it was to conform/allow the options present, rather than architected to allow the widest variety of options possible. This is probably a shinzen target issue. Changelog Added supplementalFonts support... this is getting a bit rediculous. Perhaps I should have a manifest section that lists all static files to bring over, rather than this ever growing colloection of piecemeal include lists... NotesBootstrap#{ Reference Bootstrap } AccessIn publish() they set opts.private = true for -p. Otherwise it's opts.access = \"protected\" for -a protected (for instance). The access rules as written are a bit strange to me. I ought to verify them, but I'm a bit busy. As written the rule is... -a public : Only display doclets tagged as \"public\" (but not protected, private or undefined) -a protected : Only display doclets tagged as \"protected\" (but not private, public or undefined... weird, right?) -a private : Only display doclets tagged as \"private\" (but not public, protected or undefined) -a undefined : Only display doclets which are not tagged. -p or -a all : Render everything. LogWhen setting up I tried to simply set template to \"./template\", but ran into an odd require bug with not being able to get jsdoc/fs.

BootstrapBootstrap is a \"css framework\" basically describing a methodology and thought process for how to think about using css to layout pages (and a whoooolllleee bunch of css following that methodology, at least in theory). Bootstrap is used by docstrap, and hense why it is here. CollapseBootstrap has its own methodology on how to do collapsibles, which I haven't looked at. Bootstrap's documentation on Collapsible. Glyhpicons-HalflingsBootstrap uses its own glyphicons font, similar to font-awesome (only not as awesome). They are also not free, but have a special use permission for bootstrap. Go figure. Like font-awesome, they have their own css settings. In this case, they include content property references for various icons which is helpful. Check down around lines 2650+. Or search for font-family: 'Glyph. If this doesn't work for you, there is this stackoverflow discussion referencing glyphicons in css which includes a bunch in shorthand. See also the glyphicon documentation on using glyphicons because, you know, authority and stuff. This page also has a handy display of all available icons. × Search results Close "},"tutorial-Usage.html":{"id":"tutorial-Usage.html","title":"Tutorial: Usage","body":" shinstrap Namespaces template/publish~view Modules basebase/chainsdocuments/binderdocuments/modeldocuments/probedocuments/schemaGruntfileink/collectormixins/bussablemixins/signalablestrings/formattemplate/publishutils/logger Classes basebase/chainsdocuments/modeldocuments/probe.queryOperatorsdocuments/probe.updateOperatorsink/collector~ACollectorink/collector~CollectorBaseink/collector~OCollectormixins/signalable~Signalutils/logger.Logger Mixins documents/schemamixins/bussablemixins/signalable Tutorials KB Usage Usage Usage Usage instructions(Author: shin@shinworks.co) Skip to | Specification Documentation | The shinstrap template is intended to be an \"in-place\" replacement for ink-docstrap. In theory, all the bootstrappy goodness you could leverage with docstrap also works with shinstrap. This mainly boils down to a toc, theming, sunlight highlighting and searching (although last I checked docstrap's theming was temporarily? broken). What this template adds to the pantheon of capabilities of jsdoc/docstrap are four features. The ability to specify display for new tags. (Skip to the Quickstart guide to adding tags) This is the primary purpose of this template. jsdoc already provides the ability to have its parsers consume unknown (new) tags, and via its \"plugins\" api, define those tags to allow parsing and decorating of the underlining AST. (If that last part didn't make sense, it means that with a plugin you can have jsdoc actually record/do something internally with tags you make up). What was missing from the jsdoc suite of tools was a template which could then display a newly defined tag. The methodology to date was to jury rig a fragile solution by stuffing the information from a given tag into the display information for another tag (typically description)*. The former has many issues, of course, including styling, ordering and munging of page structure. (*Or one would make an entirely new template). shinstrap allows you to define when, where and how you want your tags to be displayed. With shinstrap you define the display information in your project's .jsdoc.json (or whatever you've called your jsdoc conf file). (go here for a quickstart in jsdoc). (go here for documentation on jsdoc's configuration file). (go here for a quick overview of how to build a simple jsdoc plugin to recognize new tags). All template settings in jsdoc are stored under the \"templates\" field in the config file's json structure. For tag definitions in shinstrap you want to decorate templates.customizeOutput. The \"JSONPtr\" path from there depends on where you want your tag to be displayed. (Note that while the primary focus is on new tags, but you can also override how existing tags are displayed as well). By default, most jsdoc templates (including docstrap) inherit their structure from the default jsdoc template. This template uses a particular hierarchy of .tmpl files to display its documentation (these are just underscore templates. Fortunately, this hierarchy is pretty simple. At the root, you have container.tmpl. This handles most of the top-level entities which are getting documented (e.g. modules, classes, namespaces, etc.). This template then calls, as needed method.tmpl and details.tmpl. These are the only templates you are likely going to need to know about to display your new tags. With this understanding in hand, you are ready to add display specifications for your new tag to shinstrap. Let's say you wanted to add an @notes tag, similar to @desc, but listed separately at the end of each documented object's details listing. Assuming you had your plugin written to generate your tag information, you could define its display simply by adding to your jsdoc config file... \"customizeOutput\" { \"details\": { \"order\": [ \"*\", \"notes\" ], \"tags\": { \"notes\" : { \"title\": \"h5\", \"wrapper\": \"div\" } } } }There are three pieces to this specification. \"notes\" : { \"title\": \"h5\", \"wrapper\": \"div\" }Defines the new tag. There are several possible options, and in fact, these are the defaults for details.tmpl, but specified here for demonstration purposes. The title field indicates what the title of the listing should be wrapped in (you can set what the title should be or suppress its display, but by default it will use the name of the tag as the title, in this case \"notes\"). The wrapper field tells shinstrap in what html element to wrap the value of doclet.notes. This will generate a listing like &lt;h5&gt;notes&lt;/h5&gt; &lt;div&gt;Whatever the contents (\"value\") of the notes were. Technically `shinstrap` will look for `doclet.notes` here by default.&lt;/div&gt;The second piece comes from this line. \"all\": [ \"*\", \"notes\" ],This tells shinstrap to display the all the usual (default) listings first (\"*\") and then display the \"notes\" tag. The final piece is simply where we added the above pieces. Specifically in \"customizeOutput\" { \"details\": { ... } }Which indicates to shinstrap that these rules apply to the details.tmpl. In a practical example you'd probably want to at least specify some attributes as well, which would also go in the notes descriptor in the tags \"section\". These are covered in more detail in the Adding Tags section. The ability to add tutorial files under arbitrary menu names following standard access rules. jsdoc allows a developer to include arbitrary html or markdown files into their generated documentation as \"tutorial\" files. These normally are all listed under a \"tutorials\" menu or listing (depends on the template), with an optional hierarchy specified in the \"tutorials\" directory. (See tutorials documentation in jsdoc). shinstrap allows you to alter this behavior to split these documents up into one or more menus with whatever name(s) you desire. Further, you can tie the display of a menu (and thus the documentation underneath) to an access level, similar to other documentation pieces (i.e. similar to @private, etc. in jsdoc). \"customizeOutput\": { \"menus\" : { \"APIs\" : { \"title\": \"APIs\", \"members\": [ \"DESIGN\" ], \"access\": \"private\" }, } }The above example instructs shinstrap to build a menu called \"APIs\" and put the tutorial \"DESIGN\" in it (and thus remove it from the default \"tutorials\" group). Finally, it sets the access level for this menu to \"private\". If jsdoc is invoked with an access setting that would normally prevent generation of \"private\" tagged documentation, this menu will not be created, and the \"DESIGN\" document would (still) not be included in the default tutorials group. The ability to override this template's provided tmpl files (as well as provide your own). \"templateOverrideDir\": \"localTmpl\",tmpl files in this directory will be used before any in shinstrap's default tmpl/ directory. This allows you to either override an existing template, if you find yourself in need there of, as well as to provide new templates should you find you need complex handling for a new tag you add. The ability to add an extra css file. \"supplementalCSS\": \"local.css\",While docstrap already allows you to theme and modify via its grunt-less-bootstrap build system, sometimes it is convenient to be able to add simple bits of css patchwork. Some people may feel that allowing such a \"back door\" opens the way to abuse and bad practices, bad structure and violation of the spirit and purpose of less, bootstrap or docstrap. So don't do that. Practically speaking, however, I find it is often convenient to be able to quickly add in small bits of finalizing css. Adding Tags | Skip to the Add a New Tag Quickstart | This is the primary use case of this template, and thus is getting a called out walk through here. On a macro level there are two principal steps to adding a custom jsdoc tag into the jsdoc ecosystem. First, you need to create a plugin to teach the jsdoc parser how to recognize and parse your new tag. Second, (which is what shinstrap adds to the equation), you need to specify to your template (shinstrap) how your new document tag should be rendered. Adding a jsdoc tag pluginThis is not actually a part of shinstrap at all, but the standard mechanism in jsdoc to add a custom tag. The jsdoc documentation for this is located here. Basically, you create a plugin module which exports a defineTags function. This function takes one parameter, a \"dictionary\" object which provides a defineTag function which your plugin calls to define its tags. The defineTag function takes a tag name and a descriptor object. The tag name is the tag literal without the @ sign that you are defining. So if your tag is @notes, this is \"notes\". The descriptor object describes the tag's behavior and how it should be parsed. The most important part of the descriptor object is the onTagged field, which sets the function to call when a tag of your new type is discovered. This is where you then have the chance to do any handling you want to decide how to package up the information around your tag and decorate the associated doclet. Again, the documentation is here. Here are some examples. dictionary.defineTag(\"design\", { mustHaveValue: true, canHaveType: false, canHaveName: false, onTagged: function (doclet, tag) { doclet.design = tag.value; } });This is a basic custom tag. It defines an @design tag, which must have a value mustHaveValue: true. The value specified in any comment tag found will be recorded on the doclet in doclet.design (this is what onTagged is doing). dictionary.defineTag(\"honors\", { mustHaveValue: false, canHaveType: true, canHaveName: true, onTagged: function (doclet, tag) { if(doclet.honors === undefined) { doclet.honors = []; } doclet.honors.push({ name: tag.value.name, type: tag.value.type, description: tag.value.description, defaultvalue: tag.value.defaultvalue }); } });This defines an honors tag (@honors). The values canHaveType and canHaveName will cause jsdoc to parse @honors {object} usePartial description with \"honors\" as the tag.value.name, \"object\" as the tag.value.type, and \"description\" as tag.value.description. This is the same pattern as the standard @params document comment. The onTagged function takes the parsed tag information from jsdoc and pushes it onto the associated doclet onto an array called honors. shinstrap uses this tag to document what settings a given template will make use of in a presentation practically identical to how @params works. dictionary.defineTag(\"template\", { mustHaveValue: true, canHaveType: false, canHaveName: true, onTagged: function (doclet, tag) { doclet.kind = \"template\"; // Name specified? var m = tag.text.match(/^(\\w+)\\s+(\\w+(?:\\.(?!tmpl)\\w*)*\\.tmpl)/); if(m) { doclet.name = m[1]; doclet.template = m[2]; } else { // Match detail.tmpl or detail.blah.tmpl, etc... var m = tag.text.match(/^(\\w+)(?:\\.(?!tmpl)\\w*)*\\.tmpl/); if(m &amp;&amp; m.length &gt; 0) { doclet.name = m[1]; } else { doclet.name = tag.text; } doclet.template = tag.text; } doclet.scope = \"static\"; } });This is the definition for the @template document comment. This jsdoc comment tag allows one to create an entry describing a template (which can not be directly commented as jsdoc can not parse a tmpl file--at least until I fork jsdoc, itself). When found this tag's onTagged callback does a few things. Internally, doclets are created with custom ids using jsdoc's \"namepath\" specification. These ids are built based on a tag's name. This tag is creating a doclet and giving it a name, which will then be used to derive its custom id. Namepaths in jsdoc give \".\"s a special meaning, which causes jsdoc to get confused when building the id for the associated doclet if the name contains \".\"s (like, for instance, if it were the name of a template file, which all have the extention .tmpl--e.g. container.tmpl). To get around this, onTagged does some simple regex parsing. If the @template tag has a name, it uses that value for the name of the resulting doclet. If it does not, it will generate a name by parsing the value of the @template tag. It then records the actual file name of the template in doclet.template. Finally, by usage convention, all templates are considered to be \"static\" members of the module which uses them (doclet.scope=\"static\"). You can verify if your tags are being parsed as you would like them by a number of methods. Most easily, you can directly debug jsdoc. You can output information on the console from your onTagged function. You can also ask jsdoc to print out all of the doclets it has generated for your source code by specifying -X on the commandline. This can be very verbose, so you might want to redirect it into a file you can peruse. Specifying Tag Display in shinstrapOnce you have jsdoc parsing and decorating its AST with your tag information, you will most likely want to get it rendered in your documentation. This is where shinstrap comes in. Rendering specifications are enumerated in the templates setting of your jsdoc configuration file. For the most part, the bulk of the settings will live in templates.customizeOptions. You can read the detailed specifications here. The basic idea for tag display is if a doclet/data chunk has data for your tag then we want to render some HTML tag structure with that data in it. This first part is typically quite simple. All tag rules intrinsically associate their tag name with the presence of a field with the same name on the doclet. So a notes tag will expect to find doclet.notes to be present. If it is not present, then it assumes that doclet has no notes. So from the tag examples above, the design tag would be defined in the \"tags\" section under \"design\", because it records the value of the tag in doclet.design. If for some quixotic reason you decided to make a take called @foo and its onTagged() stored its value in doclet.bar, your tag rule for your @foo tag would want to live in tags.bar. The only exception to this rule are tags which make use of the special find keyword (to find and associate data to a doclet via some set of search criteria on the AST). The find keyword is described in more detail in the tags specificaton section. There are two parts to a render specification for a tag. There is the html structure in which its information should be rendered, and there is the question of where and in what order that html structure should be rendered. shinstrap separates these specifications into two separate \"sections\" called \"order\" and \"tags\". These are effectively namespaced by the template to which they apply (the template in which you want your tag data to be rendered). In shinstrap the standard templates which one cares about in this regard are container.tmpl, method.tmpl and details.tmpl. These are described in more detail in the templates section. This gives the configuartion file's \"templates\" section the following structure for specifying rendering information for custom tags: { \"customizeOutput: { \"container\" : { ... }, \"method\": { ... }, \"details\": { ... } } }With each section containing the specifications for its associated template. The internals of these sections then specify the \"order\" and the \"tags\" structure information. \"method\": { \"all\": [ \"description\", \"design\", \"*\" ], \"tags\": { \"design\": { \"title\": \"h5\", \"titleAttributes\": \"class='jsdoc-design-title subsection-title'\", \"wrapper\": \"div\", \"wrapperAttributes\" : \"class=jsdoc-design-body\" } } }The \"all\" entry is an \"order\" specifier. The \"tags\" entry describes the structure to emit when rendering your tag. In the above example, the \"order\" of [ \"description\", \"design\", \"*\" ] indicates to shinstrap that it should first render any description for the doclet, then any design, and then any remaining listings for the doclet which method.tmpl considers to be default (those tags which docstrap would have rendered in its method.tmpl). The \"tags\" section tells shinstrap how to render the data in the event that it is present (i.e. in the event there is a doclet.design). In this case it will render a title (based on the default \"design\") in an &lt;h5&gt; element with the attribute class='jsdoc-design-title subsection-title'. The value will be rendered after that in a &lt;div&gt; element with the attribute class=jsdoc-design-body. These are all class attributes here, but this is arbitrary, they could as easily have been foo=true, bar=false, baz=left. The \"tags\" section can take a number of values to specify a variety of rendering options. These are described more fully in the tags section. As for the other example tags. @honors \"method\": { \"all\": [ \"template\", \"honors\", \"description\", \"remarks\", \"*\", \"futures\" ], \"honors\" : { \"title\": \"h5\", \"titleAttributes\": \"class=jsdoc-honors\", \"titleCaption\": \"&lt;em&gt;Honors&lt;/em&gt; the following configuration settings:\", \"usePartial\": \"params.tmpl\" }Again, this specification effects the methods.tmpl template. Tag specifications for container.tmpl are a bit more complicated because there are multiple valid template namespaces. First because container.tmpl has two sections--an overview section and a body section, and second because there are two rendering paths for the overview section--the default and the \"module-with-modules\" case. None of that is relevant to this example. Here, we define honors information to be rendered after the template information but before the description. This might seem confusing if you are thinking about it, because we're doing something a bit confusing with our naming patterns here vis a vis template which will become more clear in the next example. For now, focus on the honors part. If there is any honors data in doclet.honors for the doclet being examined by method.tmpl it will render a title in an &lt;h5&gt; element with the attribute class=jsdoc-honors. The title's innerHTML value will be &lt;em&gt;Honors&lt;/em&gt; the following configuration settings:, so in other words it will render... &lt;h5 class=jsdoc-honors&gt;&lt;em&gt;Honors&lt;/em&gt; the following configuration settings:&lt;/h5&gt;To render the value for doclet.honors shinstrap will delegate that rendering to the params.tmpl template, which is the template used to render @params for methods (recall that in our tag creation example above, we had jsdoc parse @honors in the same fashion as @params only keeping a subset of the possible things @params can specify). doclet.honors just like doclet.params is an array of values, and thus we get the familiar output we expect. We could, instead have provided our own template here by specifying \"usePartial\": \"honors.tmpl\" for example, setting a templateOverrideDir and creating our own honors.tmpl file there. @template@template is our big example in this walk through, because it shows a couple of techniques at once. First, recall our tag parsing and doclet generation process above--We recorded the name of the template as the doclet.name, its kind as template and the actual file name of the template as doclet.template \"container\": { \"body\": { \"all\" : [ \"augments\", \"requires\", \"classes\", \"mixins\", \"namespaces\", \"templates\", \"*\" ], \"tags\" : { \"templates\": { \"find\": { \"kind\": \"template\", \"memberof\": \"_doclet.longname\" }, \"validate\": \"_doclet.kind !== 'globalobj'\", \"title\": \"h3\", \"titleAttributes\": \"class=subsection-title\", \"outerWrapper\": \"dl\", \"usePerItemPartial\": \"method.tmpl\" } } } }, \"method\": { \"all\": [ \"template\", \"honors\", \"description\", \"remarks\", \"*\", \"futures\" ], \"tags\": { \"template\": { \"title\": \"h5\", \"titleCaption\": \"Template File:\", \"alternateHandler\": \"listing.scaffolded.kv.tmpl\", \"wrapper\": \"span\", \"wrapperAttributes\": \"class=jsdoc-template-filename\" } } }Here we're specifying two separate entries. The first in container.body is the \"root\" entry for a template as specified by @template. container.tmpl renders a variety of \"first order\" doclets like modules, mixins and namespaces. By convention, we use our @template document comment as members of a module for documentation purposes. This association is actually done explicitly using @memberof module:.... When container.tmpl reaches the template entry it checks to see if it has a value for that entry on its current doclet in order to decide if it should render it. Unlike the usual pattern for simple entries, the template tag description for container.body has a find specification. This tells container.tmpl that this entry is valid and should be rendered if it can find any doclets of kind \"template\" which are memberof _doclet.longname (the doclet container.tmpl is looking at). This is how jsdoc associates doclets with each other. The same mechanics are used to find classes, mixins, etc. which are members of a given module, methods in classes, etc. If container.tmpl finds any such doclets it will then attempt to validate (superfluously in this case) them according to the conditions in validate. All doclets which pass this validation step are then rendered. The next settings should seem familiar. title and titleAttributes cause an html &lt;h3&gt; element to be rendered with the attribute class=subsection-title and the caption/innerHTML of templates. outerWrapper then renders a &lt;dl&gt; element the contents of which are whatever is rendered by method.tmpl. usePerItemPartial specifies that method.tmpl should be called for each doclet that came back from the find and passed validation. Note that outerWrapper is specified here because wrapper and usePerItemPartial both address the same \"level\" of nested output (usePerItemPartial also has higher precedence, but either way would be broken for what we want to achieve). This is where our second tag specification comes in. So far, we've rendered a title and are rendering a method.tmpl for each of our template doclets created by our @template tag definition we defined above. method.tmpl will take care of rendering most anything else we have defined on our template doclet, like @desc, @author or @see tags, etc. as well as our custom @honors tag. But in our @template definition we did one other thing, we decorated our template doclet with another value--template containing the file name of the template. (We might have considered naming it something else, like filename). method.tags.template describes how to render that data when method.tmpl encounters a doclet with a template field. The settings for template should be largely familiar by now. title and titleAttributes specify the title (with the default caption of template). wrapper and wrapperAttributes indicate that we want shinstrap to render a &lt;span class=jsdoc-template-filename&gt; for each entry. The alternateHandler entry is new. The vast majority of custom listings are handled in shinstrap by listing.scaffolded.general.tmpl. This entry says rather than use that template, which renders a title followed by a value in separate wrappers, shinstrap should use listing.scaffolded.kv.tmpl. kv in this case stands for \"key-value\". Which is to say we want to see &lt;title-wrapper&gt;...&lt;value-wrapper&gt;...&lt;/value-wrapper&gt;&lt;/title-wrapper&gt;. There are a few key-value styled listings rendered in docstrap by default, and these have been reproduced in shinstrap. The available rendering options are described in more detail in the tags section. | Specifcations in Detail | Adding a Tag -- QuickstartTo quickly add a new tag and see it working, follow these steps. First, make sure you have everything you need installed. npm install --save-dev jsdoc npm install --save-dev shinstrap Second, you need to create a simple jsdoc plugin to teach jsdoc how it should annotate the information conveyed by your tag. This requires creating a javascript file (a jsdoc plugin). If you intend to use the same set of tags in multiple projects you will likely want to make these tags into a module and use your favorite package management system to deploy them. For this example, however, we'll just put them into a file at the root of your project. jsdoc-tags.js: exports.defineTags = function (dictionary) { dictionary.defineTag(\"notes\", { mustHaveValue: true, canHaveType: false, canHaveName: false, onTagged: function (doclet, tag) { doclet.notes = tag.value; } }); }; Note that the above is standard jsdoc plugin format and is valid outside the context of shinstrap. Setup your .jsdoc.json file. There are many settings you might want to set in your configuration file, but for the moment, create this file at the root of your project with the following content. { \"tags\": { \"allowUnknownTags\": true }, \"plugins\": [ \"jsdoc-tags.js\" ], \"excludePattern\": \"(^|\\\\/|\\\\\\\\)\", \"recurseDepth\": 5, \"source\": { \"exclude\": [ \"node_modules\" ] }, \"opts\": { \"template\": \"node_modules/shinstrap/template\" }, \"templates\": { \"customizeOutput\": { \"container\" : { \"article\" : { \"overview\": { \"all\" : [ \"description\", \"notes\", \"*\" ], \"tags\" : { \"notes\": { \"title\": \"h5\", \"titleAttributes\": \"class='jsdoc-notes-title subsection-title'\", \"wrapper\": \"div\", \"wrapperAttributes\" : \"class=jsdoc-notes-body\" } } } } } } } } This specifies a couple of things to jsdoc, many of which are \"standard\" (like anything I don't specifically call out here). \"tags\": { \"allowUnknownTags\": true } tells jsdoc to accept without error comment tags which it does not recognize. This isn't strictly speaking necessary if all your comment tag types are covered by your plugin. \"opts\": { \"template\": \"node_modules/shinstrap/template\" } indicates which template you want to use to render your documentation. \"templates\": {...} are the settings specific to that template. For shinstrap the custom rendering information for your new comment tag is in templates.customizeOutput.container.article.overview. That path indicates when the new tag will be rendered. The fields inside templates.customizeOutput.container.article.overview.tags.notes dictate the specific html structure to be rendered. templates.customizeOutput.container.article.overview.all specifies where amongst the various doclet's listings the new tag's listing should go. Make sure you have a source file with your new comment tag in it ;) /** * @module test * @desc * This is a gratuitous description put in as part of my test. * @notes * This is an example of using my new document tag. */ Generate the documentation. From the root of your project, enter into the command line... ./node_modules/.bin/jsdoc -c ./.jsdoc.json -d docs/ -r . This will create your documentation into the docs/ directory (change the value of the -d parameter if you want to put it elsewhere). -r specifies to build the documentation by looking at all valid source files in this directory descending recursively down (to up to 5 levels deep, from our setting in .jsdoc.json -- \"recurseDepth\": 5). The -c option tells jsdoc where to find your configuration file. If you decide to name your config file something other than .jsdoc.json you can change it here. There are other CLI options for jsdoc, you can find them here. At this point you should have some nicely generated documentation (well, at least to the extent that you have jsdoc comments in your source code). The \"root\" of your documentation should be located in docs/index.html. Specifications in Detail supplementalCSS supplementalJS supplementalFonts templateOverrideDir customizeOutput menu section doclets section template sections order field tags field supplementalCSSThis is a simple configuration setting to specify an additional css file to include with all generated documentation. It follows the same discovery rules as all other jsdoc resource files. It is added after other css files for overriding porpoises. \"supplementalCSS\": \"local.css\" supplementalJSThis setting accepts either a string or an array of strings each specifying the path to a javascript source file (discovered as a resource) which should be included with the documentation's static files and loaded on every page of the documentation. shinstrap does not currently have a mechanism to include a js file in the manifest but not have it referenced on every generated documentation page. \"supplementalJS\": [ \"local1.js\", \"node_modules/@someone/mymodule/lib/rearrangeViaCheerioBecauseImCrazy.js\" ] supplementalFontssupplementalFonts setting accepts a stringPath or an array of stringPaths to files which should be included into the generated documentation's static files. \"supplementalFonts\": [ \"node_modules/@someone/otfCreations/fonts/myCoolFont.woff\" ] templateOverrideDirThis is a project relative directory path to a directory which should be added to the template discovery path at the highest precedence. When shinstrap looks for a template, either internally or via a tag specification (e.g. usePartial), it will look for that template in the directory specified by this value before looking anywhere else. \"templateOverrideDir\": \"localTmpl\" customizeOutput| menu | doclets | template | order | tags | This is the section where the bulk of the shinstrap-specific specifications live (in theory, shinstrap will also honor any settings understood by docstrap--it is a fork of docstrap after all). customizeOutput has three general \"types\" of keys--The menu key, the doclets key (probably best ignored), and the \"template\" keys. Currently there are four \"valid\" template keys, method, container, details, and members. Menu Section\"customizeOutput\": { \"menus\" : { \"APIs\" : { \"title\": \"APIs\", \"order\": 1, // Ignored atm \"members\": [ \"DESIGN\" ], \"access\": \"private\" }, \"Usage\" : { \"title\": \"Usage\", \"members\": [\"Usage\"] } } }The \"menus\" section allows you to specify custom menus for the navbar in which you would like so-called \"tutorial\" files referenced. tutorials are a feature of jsdoc which allows you to associate and include arbitrary html and markdown documents into your auto-generated documentation. jsdoc will include these pages in a menu called \"tutorials\". In shinstrap you can go a bit farther. shinstrap allows you to \"subvert\" this feature to include such documents in one or more menus with names of your choice. The specification excerpt above is one such example. The keys in the \"menus\" section are the internal ids for the menus in question. These ids should be valid identifiers. Each key holds an object which describes its associated menu. Currently there are three valid fields in this object. title {string} : The desired title for the menu in the navigation bar. members {array} : The documents to include in this menu. As with jsdoc's own tutorial configuration files, the string elements of this array are filenames without their extension, which is how jsdoc associates these \"weak\" ids with their respective files. Any file listed as a member of any menu will be removed from the default tutorials menu (even if they are not otherwise included due to access settings--see below). If there are no actual \"tutorial\" files left, no tutorials menu will be generated (your custom menus, though, will be assuming access). access {string} : This setting allows you to specify that a given menu should be rendered only if the access level for the auto-generated documentation calls for it. This setting parallels the same rules for access as jsdoc uses for other doclets. Documents included in custom menus will still honor any of the usual jsdoc tutorial settings--namely children and title. As of the inital release of shinstrap these are still specified in the normal places for jsdoc, despite it making more sense to move those specifications into the primary jsdoc configuration file. shinstrap also does not alter the jsdoc pattern for tutorial inclusion (it's still just a folder). Easy to change, just not done. Doclets SectionThis is a bit of a dangerous curves section and best ignored by most users. It is also of limited use at this moment. This section allows the specification of additional processing on doclets by kind, similar to what docstrap performs for certain built-in doclet kinds. By and large this has to do with generating attribute lists and call signatures for display. In shinstrap, attribs rendering has been moved to partial.scaffolded.attribs.tmpl. This example section indicates that the specified doclet kind (\"template\" in this case) should be preprocessed by calling addAttribs(doclet), shinHelpers.addScopeToAttribs(doclet) and addSignatureTypes(doclet) in that order before doclets are rendered. Effective use of this specification requires internal understanding of docstrap/shinstrap and is thus probably not useful (at this juncture). \"customizeOutput\": { \"doclets\" : { // This is where I could add rules to allow generation of separate pages \"template\": { \"processing\" : [ \"addAttribs\", \"shinHelpers.addScopeToAttribs\", \"addSignatureTypes\" ] } } } Template SectionsCurrently, only three templates are wired to \"honor\" template customization specifications--container.tmpl, method.tmpl, and details.tmpl. Each of these takes an \"order\" specification and a \"tags\" specification. The \"tags\" specification is always under the key tags as an object with the name of each tag specification as a key (each tag specification is, itself, an object). The tag specification format is described here. The \"order\" specification is listed under a field name based on the circumstances to which it applies (\"all\" being the default case). For method.tmpl (\"customizeOutput.method\") and details.tmpl (\"customizeOutput.details\") \"all\" is the only valid case. container.tmpl is more complicated however. The container template has two sections--an \"overview\" section and a \"body\". Further, the \"overview\" section has a two separate rendering paths, depending on the doclet being rendered--It might be a module containing other modules, or it could be something (anything) else (container.tmpl as the root template is invoked to render classes, but these it punts to method.tmp). The specifications for these cases are delineated by the keys used to contain those specifications. The templates.customizeOutput.container.body covers the specifications for the \"body\" section of the container. The templates.customizeOutput.container.overview section covers specifications for the \"overview\" section. This section is further potentially divided by its two render cases--templates.customizeOutput.container.overview.module-with-modules and templates.customizeOutput.container.overview.default. For this section the templates.customizeOutput.container.overview.all will be used as a fallback for any of the above which are not specified. All these branches use the same \"tags\" section, it is the \"order\" section which varies. The \"order\" specification is described here. \"customizeOutput\": { \"container\" : { \"article\" : { \"overview\": { \"all\" : [ \"description\", \"notes\", \"design\", \"*\" ], \"tags\" : { \"notes\": { \"title\": \"h5\", \"titleAttributes\": \"class='jsdoc-notes-title subsection-title'\", \"wrapper\": \"div\", \"wrapperAttributes\" : \"class=jsdoc-notes-body\" }, \"design\": { \"title\": \"h5\", \"titleAttributes\": \"class='jsdoc-design-title subsection-title'\", \"wrapper\": \"div\", \"wrapperAttributes\" : \"class=jsdoc-design-body\" } } }, \"body\": { \"all\" : [ \"augments\", \"requires\", \"classes\", \"mixins\", \"namespaces\", \"templates\", \"*\" ], \"tags\" : { \"tasks\": { \"find\": { \"kind\": \"task\", \"memberof\": \"_doclet.contents &amp;&amp; _doclet.contents.title === 'Global' ? {isUndefined: true} : _doclet.longname\" }, \"title\": \"h3\", \"titleAttributes\": \"class=subsection-title\", \"usePerItemPartial\": \"method.tmpl\" }, \"templates\": { \"find\": { \"kind\": \"template\", \"memberof\": \"_doclet.longname\" }, \"validate\": \"_doclet.kind !== 'globalobj'\", \"title\": \"h3\", \"titleAttributes\": \"class=subsection-title\", \"outerWrapper\": \"dl\", \"usePerItemPartial\": \"method.tmpl\" } } } } }, \"method\": { \"all\": [ \"template\", \"honors\", \"description\", \"remarks\", \"*\", \"futures\" ], \"tags\": { \"template\": { \"title\": \"h5\", \"titleCaption\": \"Template File:\", \"alternateHandler\": \"listing.scaffolded.kv.tmpl\", \"wrapper\": \"span\", \"wrapperAttributes\": \"class=jsdoc-template-filename\" }, \"honors\" : { \"title\": \"h5\", \"titleAttributes\": \"class=jsdoc-honors\", \"titleCaption\": \"&lt;em&gt;Honors&lt;/em&gt; the following configuration settings:\", \"usePartial\": \"params.tmpl\" }, \"remarks\": { \"title\": \"h5\", \"titleAttributes\": \"class='jsdoc-remarks-title capitalize-title'\", \"wrapper\": \"div\", \"wrapperAttributes\" : \"class=jsdoc-remarks-body\" }, \"futures\": { \"title\": \"dt\", \"titleCaption\": \"Futures:\", \"titleAttributes\": \"class='tag-futures capitalize-title method-doc-label method-doc-details-label'\", \"outermostWrapper\": \"dd\", \"outermostWrapperAttributes\": \"class=tag-futures\", \"outerWrapper\": \"ul\", \"wrapper\": \"li\" }, \"attribs\": { \"alternateHandler\": \"partial.scaffolded.attribs.tmpl\", \"template\": { \"displayStyle\": \"badges\" } } } }, \"details\": { \"all\": [ \"todo\", \"*\" ] }, \"members\": { \"tags\": { \"attribs\": { \"alternateHandler\": \"partial.scaffolded.attribs.tmpl\", \"template\": { \"displayStyle\": \"csl\" } } } } } Note that the members section does not actually honor \"order\" or \"tags\" per se, but like method it does make use of partial.scaffolded.attribs.tmpl which, as a scaffolded template does honor tag specifications which, when referenced from members.tmpl will look for a tag specification in templates.customizeOutput.members.tags. The \"Order\" fieldAn \"order\" field specifies the order in which listings should be rendered for a given doclet. This field takes an array of strings which specifies the order by tag name in which the listings should be rendered. The special identifier \"*\" is a catch all, meaning \"all the default listings which I have not explictly placed elsewhere\". Note the default callout. Each template (from docstrap) has a default, expected set of listing to output. So, for instance, shinstrap normally displays the following tags in method.tmpl: [ \"description\", \"augments\", \"type\", \"this\", \"params\", \"details\", \"requires\", \"fires\", \"listens\", \"listeners\", \"exceptions\", \"returns\", \"examples\" ]So an \"order\" entry in templates.customizeOutputs.method.all of [\"*\"] will result in the listings above being rendered in that order. [ \"notes\", \"*\", \"futures\" ]Would result in first the \"notes\" tag being rendered, then all the defaults, and finally the \"futures\" tag. You can also specify ordering for default tags, and as indicated above, the \"*\" will only include default listings which are not already specified. [ \"description\", \"notes\", \"*\", \"futures\", \"examples\" ]Would result in the following ordering [ \"description\", \"notes\", \"augments\", \"type\", \"this\", \"params\", \"details\", \"requires\", \"fires\", \"listens\", \"listeners\", \"exceptions\", \"returns\", \"futures\", \"examples\" ] The \"tags\" sectionThe tags section of customizeOutput allows you to specify how you want a given set of data to be displayed for a given doclet (by template, see template sections above for more detail). Within each template namespace the tags sub section contains an entry for each tag whose rendering you wish to control (or override). The tags specification for the default tags are all located in defaults.json. These can be useful as examples. (At this time), there are two templates which control the rendering of data (or a listing in shinstrap terminology)--listing.scaffolded.general.tmpl(module:template/publish.General) and listing.scaffolded.kv.tmpl(module:template/publish.KeyValue). (If this were shinmark-based, I'd pull the honors data directly out of the relevant files). The primary difference between these two templates is how they structure their output. The general pattern is to emit a fully formed and closed title element followed by a fully formed and closed value element (with some possible degree of structure nesting). The \"KV\" template allows for a key-value pattern where the \"title\" element contains the \"value\" element. The list of which customization settings each template honors is listed in the associated template documentation in the publish module (module:template/publish). listing.scaffolded.general.tmpl is the default handler for all listings (unless the tags setting alternateHandler is used). \"templates\": { \"customizeOutput\": { \"container\" : { \"article\" : { \"overview\": { \"all\" : [ \"description\", \"notes\", \"*\" ], \"tags\" : { \"notes\": { \"title\": \"h5\", \"titleAttributes\": \"class='jsdoc-notes-title subsection-title'\", \"wrapper\": \"div\", \"wrapperAttributes\" : \"class=jsdoc-notes-body\" } } } } } } }In the example above, the tags section is in the container.article.overview \"namespace\". Which is to say that the settings in the excerpted tags section apply to the \"overview\" section of the \"article\" in container.tmpl. The tags section has only one listing in this example (but it could have many)--the \"notes\" entry. This setting instructs shinstrap when rendering the overview section of the article element in container.tmpl to watch for doclets with a doclet.notes defined. If such is encountered, shinstrap will use listing.scaffolded.general.tmpl to render the doclet.notes information. The general listing template in turn will look at the settings inside of container.article.overview.tags.notes to decide how to render the listing. In the example above, it emits a title in an &lt;h5&gt; element with the attribute class='jsdoc-notes-title subsection-title' followed by a &lt;div&gt; element with the attribute class=jsdoc-notes-body containing the actual data in doclet.notes. Most settings are \"ignored\" if not present for a given tag. Each scaffolded template has its own defaults for the wrapper and titleWrapper settings if neither specified nor overridden. The tag specifiers in the tags section leverage a number of general case settings: wrapper {string} : The html element to generate for the list value. wrapperAttributes {string} : The attributes for the wrapper tag. outerWrapper {string} : An html element to wrap the wrapper in. outerWrapperAttributes {string} : The attributes for the outerWrapper tag. outermostWrapper {string} : The outer most (third) wrapping html element for the wrapper tag. Since each level is ignored individually if not specified, an outermostWrapper for a tag without an outerWrapper will effectively behave like an outerWrapper. outermostWrapperAttributes {string} : The attributes for the outermostWrapper tag. suppressTitle {boolean} : If true will instruct shinstrap to suppress rendering of any title or title elements. This invalidates all the title settings listed below. titleWrapper {string} : The html element to wrap the listing's title in. titleWrapperAttributes {string} : The attributes for the titleWrapper tag. outerTitleWrapper {string} : An html element to wrap the titleWrapper element within. outerTitleWrapperAttributes {string} : The attributes for the outerTitleWrapper tag. titleCaption {string} : A replacement for the default title (which is based on the tag name). titleContextPluralize {object} : An awkward setting 8D. This is an object with two keys singular and plural. If the associated data is has only one value (length === 1), the string value of the key singular will be used. More than one, and the plural value will be used for the title. titleInterpolation {string} : :es6: This setting instructs shinstrap to interpret the provide value as a template string and use it for the listing's title. There are also a few more advanced setting options. Identifying the dataBy default, in most cases, the presence of data needing to be rendered is inferred implicitly from the name of the tag. \"notes\" above implies the presence of a doclet.notes value. If that value is not present it means that there are no notes to render for this entity. In the unlikely case that additional validation is required, it can be specified in a validate setting. The value of this setting is a string which must evaluate to true in order for the perspective listing to be considered \"valid\" or necessary for rendering. See writing eval expression for more information. For certain types of data, particularly associating disparate doclets with each other, it is necessary to instead specify a find. When a find is indicated, a value on doclet is not looked for. Instead, shinstrap performs a find (taffyDB) with the parameters specified. As written, find currently only will accept a kind and a memberof field. kind is taken literally, but for legacy purposes, memberof is evaluated, in the event that the memberof needs to reference another object (like the doclet itself--e.g doclet.longname). See writing eval expression below for more information. For specifics on how find works, see module:template/publish.handleScaffolding. Handling \"Complex\" EntriesThere are a number of prebuilt template handlers for a variety of documentable entities like params, members, sources, properties, etc. At this time not all of these templates are documented, however (module:template/publish). New templates can also be created and added to the templateOverrideDir. To leverage one of these templates (new or old) with a tag (again, new or old) you can use one of a few different handler specifiers. alternateHandler : Allows you to specify a scaffolded handler to use instead of listing.scaffolded.general.tmpl. At this time the only other scaffolded handler is listing.scaffolded.kv.tmpl. defer : The counterpart to alternateHandler, defer will defer rendering of a listing to the template specified without any scaffolding. Use this to have old school docstrap templates render your entity. usePartial : This setting instructs shinstrap to utilize the specified template (without scaffolding) to generate the \"wrapper\" portion of an entity. Title rendering (and any outerWrappers) are still controlled by the primary listing template. New templates conducive for use with this setting are named partial.*.tmpl. The behavior of this setting can be further customized with usePartialOnField which instructs shinstrap to pass into the template the field on the data entity specified. (e.g. if working on data.notes and usePartialOnField was set to \"special\", shinstrap would call the usePartial specified template on data.notes.special). usePerItemPartial : This setting is similar to usePartial except that it is only valid with data entries which are arrays (technically forEachable). Rather than being called once for the entire entry, the template is called forEach element in the data entry. perItemMapPartial : This setting takes an object. The keys in that object represent cases in which the associated value template should be used. { \"i.signature\" : \"method.tmpl\", \"default\": \"members.tmpl\" }For purposes of perItemMapPartial, i is the item in question for reflection purposes. \"default\" is the default template to use should none of the other cases be valid. These keys are treated as eval fields. Item MarshallingThe itemMarshalling setting allows you to specify, finally, to shinstrap that you would like one or more marshalling functions called on the value before it is rendered. The same functionality can be achieved in many other ways, of course, but this feature allows for easy use of legacy marshalling functions from docstrap such as the various link creators. \"itemMarshalling\": [ [ \"linkto\", \"\", \"\" ] ]Marshallers are executed in order. The first parameter is the name of the marshaller followed by any parameters it takes. Each parameter is expected to be in reference to the data entity in question, so \"\" is the entity itself, whereas \"longname\" would amount to data.longname. Evals in Tags block (Writing eval expressions)Expressions evaluated in the context of a tags definition are handled inside module:template/publish.handleScaffolding. The main thing to note here is that the current doclet/data object is available in _doclet. You can check in defaults.json for examples of various eval expressions. For perItemMapPartial its haxtastic key-cases provide the variable i to reference the current \"item\" being considered. TemplatesThis is a bit of estoerica, really. Templates with \".\"-pathed names are wholy new as of shinstrap and did not exist in docstrap. Otherwise template names remain the same (albeit their contents may be quite different). A template with scaffolded in its name expects to be called from scaffoldPartial() one way or another. If you are writing your own templates and want to call one of these, this means you need to call self.scaffoldPartial('template.tmpl', doclet, listing) or self.scaffoldPartialBySpec('template.tmpl', doclet, \"template:specifier\"). If you are doing this sort of thing, you should look at the larger documentation for the template (as generated by jsdoc! 8D)--module:template/publish × Search results Close "}}
